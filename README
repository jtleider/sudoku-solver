Sudoku-Solver
5/20/13

This is a simple brute-force Python Sudoku solver. I would like to
improve it so that the code is more pythonic and also much more
efficient. Right now it is not at all elegant although it does
get the job done. I would also like to redo this using test-driven
development since the approach I took when writing this seems
quite error-prone.

The solver expects input grid in the file sudoku.txt in the current
working directory. An example input would be the following:

003020700
900305001
001906400
008102900
700000008
006704200
002609500
800203009
005010300

The solver assumes that the input grid does in fact have a
solution.
