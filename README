Sudoku-Solver
8/21/2014

This is a simple brute-force Python Sudoku solver. It uses a Grid class to represent the Sudoku grid. I used test-driven development to create a
cleaner solution than I had initially.

The solver expects input grids in the file sudoku.txt in the current
working directory. An example input would be the following:

Grid 01
003020700
900305001
001906400
008102900
700000008
006704200
002609500
800203009
005010300

The solver will throw an error if there is no solution.

This program implements a solution to Project Euler Problem 96, which is how I initially became interested in the topic.
